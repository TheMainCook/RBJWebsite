			<h1><center>Devon Anthony Austin's Gaming Company Site</center></h1>
	
			<br>

		<!--Introduction-->

			<p>Devon Austin is a 22 year old entrepreneur with a passion for games.  His one true goal is to create his own video game that is the greatest of all games. Currently, he is developing a Turn Based Rpg using a pixel art style, though he is not sure as of yet whether he will continue this art style choice.  Devon has the support and team input of his friends to help him reach this goal.  </p>

			<p>Devon is a determined young man with wit and charm. He is skilled in multiple coding languages.  The current project for example, is to be executed in the C# language. He also has a love for art.  Because of this and his desire to be involved with his game as much as possible, he has taken on the role of digitizing the character art, as well as developing the animation.  To do this he is using the art tool, Aesprite.  He uses it hours on end to make his dreams come true.   </p>

			<p>This is the about page that houses public information of his company endeavors.  Currently, this is a mock up to the real thing.  Devon must review the site and tell me any changes he would like.  Any notes he has for me, I will keep them in the word file I have started for that purpose, the Game Website Log. I use this to refer to his preferences as well as any ideas the team may have for the site.</p>

			<p>I am super excited about this project, and I am proud Devon has asked  me to join him on a journey that is so close to his heart.</p>
